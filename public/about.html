        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Welcome to CodeAura, a cutting-edge web application designed to analyze your coding style and predict your personality traits. Our platform leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and psychological research to provide insightful personality assessments based on your code snippets.</p>
        <h1>My Mission</h1>
        <p>Personality Prediction's mission is to bridge the gap between technology and psychology. I believe that understanding personality traits can help individuals improve their coding skills, foster better teamwork, and enhance personal growth. My goal is to empower developers with knowledge about their personality through the lens of their coding habits.</p>
        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>My application uses a unique algorithm that examines various aspects of your code, including structure, complexity, and style. By analyzing these elements, I can generate a detailed personality profile that highlights your strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.</p>
        <h1>Meet the Developer</h1>
        <p>My name is Rofunwa Themeli, a passionate aspiring developer, with a lot of help from my supervisors at Synthesis Software Technologies exploring the intersection of coding and personality.</p>
        <h1>Get Involved</h1>
        <p>I am always looking for feedback and collaboration opportunities. Whether you're a developer interested in testing my app, a researcher looking to contribute to my algorithms, or simply curious about my work, I would love to hear from you. Feel free to reach out to me via my contact page.</p>
